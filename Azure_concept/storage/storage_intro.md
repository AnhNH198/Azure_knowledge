Azure Storage is Microsoft's
cloud storage solution for
modern data storage scenarios.

Core storage services
offer a massively scalable
object store for data objects,
disk storage for Azure virtual machines,
a file system service for
the cloud, a messaging store
for reliable messaging, and a NoSQL store.

Azure Blob Storage is an
object storage solution
that you can use to store massive amounts
of unstructured data, such
as text or binary data.
Blob Storage is ideal for
serving images or documents
directly to a browser,
storing data for archives
or distributed access,
streaming video and audio, and
disaster recovery scenarios.

Azure File Storage offers
fully managed file shares
in the cloud, and shares are accessible
using industry standard network protocols.
Mounting Azure file shares
is just like connecting to
shares on your local network.

Azure Disk Storage provides
disks for virtual machines
and applications to access
and use as they need -
similar to how they would access disks
that were on premises.

Azure offers both solid state drives
for higher performance workloads
and conventional hard drives
for your less critical business scenarios.

Azure Table Storage
offers a NoSQL data store
for key value pairs using
large scale datasets.
You can use Azure Table
Storage to store petabytes
of semi-structured data,
and keep your costs down.

Azure Queue Storage provides
asynchronous message queuing
for communication between
application components,
whether they're running in
the cloud, on the desktop,
on premises, or on mobile devices.

There are three Azure storage tiers
that you can use to balance your costs:
hot, cool, and archive.

The hot storage tier is optimized
for storing data that
is accessed frequently,
such as images for your website.

The cold storage tier is optimized
for data that is infrequently accessed,
and stored for at least 30
days, such as customer invoices.
And the archive storage
tier is appropriate for data
that is rarely accessed,
and stored for at least 180 days,
such as long-term backups.

Regardless of your business scenario,
Azure has a solution to help
you manage your storage needs.
